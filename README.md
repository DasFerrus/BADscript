BADscript, or Born Again Ducky script, was built to improve on the technology made by Hak5, DuckyScript, by adding extra function in the interpreter and making the script more diverse when it comes to syntax. For example: you can use "WIN" or "WINDOWS" or "GUI" to emulate a windows keypress. BAD was made with backwards compatability in mind and is able read any traditional Ducky scripts, while having improved functionality and readability.
