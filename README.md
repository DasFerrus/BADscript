Bai1eScript is a scripting language made for the BadUSB developed by Seytonic.

The language was built to improve on the technology made by Hak5, DuckyScript, by adding extra function in the interpreter and making the script more diverse when it comes to syntax. For example: you can use "WIN" or "WINDOWS" or "GUI" to emulate a windows keypress.
